## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome!
My name is Lie Reubensto (Ruben)

## About Me
I'm a Final-Year Computer Science & Mathematics Undergraduate Student from BINUS University. My passion lies in problem-solving through Applied Mathematics Modeling. Throughout my academic career, I developed a strong foundation in mathematical principles and computational techniques, which I have applied in some of my projects to solve complex problems. I also have gained hands-on experience in programming languages, such as Python, C++, and Java. With the help of these programming languages, I'm able to do the mathematical modeling computationally, making it faster and more accurate for real-time decision making.

My interest lies in leveraging optimization techniques to improve decision making processes in a real-world case. I'm eager to further explore these areas and contribute to innovative and efficient solutions.

I'm continously expanding my skills in other areas as well, such as Web Programming (with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and Machine Learning, among many others. My ultimate goal is to contribute for solutions that can be utilize by many, mainly through Desktop or Web Application. I'm eager to take on new challenges, collaborate with others in the field, and continue expanding my knowledge. I'm also thrilled to apply what I've learnt for both professional and academic settings.
